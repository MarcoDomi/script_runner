# script_runner
A python script used to execute other scripts within the same directory or in sub-directories.

I will create an alias for this in Ubuntu and use this script runner to run any future scripts. this is to avoid creating a different alias 
for each script i create in the future and avoid a bloated alias file.

**version before JSON reading functionality was implemented
