# script_runner
Conveniently execute a specified Python script from any current working directory. 

### Why 
I wanted to create a tool similar to the Windows Run dialog so I can execute a script without having to navigate to that scripts' directory. 

### How to use 
script_runner.py can accept the full script name or an abbreviation for the script.
